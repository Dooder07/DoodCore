### Features
 - This plugin is by no means complete. It is not posted here to be used as-is. 
 - All built-in features are intended for use on the Dreadcraft server (dreadcraft.net) - using them elsewhere as of now may require some modification to the code (string values, plugin hooks, etc)
 - Most everything is very modular and is designed to be expanded upon for future use without major re-writes. The following features are built-in examples of how Core can be used.
 - Works on Bukkit/Spigot and BungeeCord.
 - Global join/quit/welcome messages (BungeeCord)
 - Global staff/admin chat (BungeeCord)
 - Global player list (BungeeCord)
 - /server shortcuts (IE: /lobby or /smp) (BungeeCord)
 - Hack client detection - simple algorithms to detect some commonly used cheats
 - Block certain commands/actions based on player's distance to claimed land
 - Fixes odd teleportation glitches and lighting errors systematically
 - Limits the drops and farming of certain entities
 - Reward players for welcoming new players
 - Block certain potion crafting/usage
 - Survival PvP Management, protecting new players and combat logging
 - Nerf the amount of SkeletonHorse spawns
 - Breaking leaves drops sticks, sometimes! :o
 - Time-played based rewards
 - Force other players to chat/use commands
 - Rename and relore items, simply
 - Search a nearby radius for all entities and chest contents using item/entity name or description
 - Add/remove suspicious players to a watchlist, warning staff when they login
 - An always expanding API intended to be used in other plugins.
